# Juaniquillo's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website.

## Getting Started

To run this website locally, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the web server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start a local web server, and you can view the website by navigating to the URL provided in the console (usually `http://localhost:8080`).
