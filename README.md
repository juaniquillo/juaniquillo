## Here's a little bit about me written by some very nice AI agent.

Hey! I’m Victor — a web developer who’s been mixing creativity and code since dial‑up was still a thing. I started out as an illustrator, fell head‑first into web development, and never looked back.

These days I spend my time building clean, functional and accesible web experiences with my favorite combo: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. As my resume puts it, I’ve spent years “creating web applications using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP & MySQL” — and honestly, that’s where I have the most fun.

My art background (MFA + BFA in drawing and printmaking) still sneaks into everything I do — from layouts to color choices to the occasional doodle in my notebook.

I’m based in sunny San Juan, fluent in English and Spanish, and always ready for a new project, a new challenge, or a new excuse to overthink a font choice.
