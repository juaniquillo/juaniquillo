## Here's a little bit about me written by some very nice AI agent.

Hey! I’m Victor — a web developer who’s been mixing creativity and code since dial‑up was still a thing. I started out as an illustrator, fell head‑first into web development, and never looked back.

These days I spend my time building clean, functional and accessible web experiences with my favorite combo: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, and honestly, that’s where I have the most fun.

On the backend, I’m happiest working with Laravel, especially when I get to build with Blade or Livewire. I also enjoy mixing in tools like Vue, Inertia, and the occasional Node.js project when it fits the problem. On the front end, I love working with semantic HTML, modern CSS and just‑enough JavaScript — whether that’s vanilla or something a bit more reactive. I’m comfortable with Git, deployment workflows, actions and all the little pieces that make a project feel polished and maintainable.

My art background (MFA + BFA in drawing and printmaking) still sneaks into everything I do — from layouts to color choices to the occasional doodle in my sketchbook.

I’m based in sunny San Juan, fluent in English and Spanish, and always ready for a new project, a new challenge, or a new excuse to overthink a font choice.
